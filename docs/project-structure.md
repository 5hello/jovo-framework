- `build`: Files generated by the [`build` command](https://www.jovo.tech/docs/build-command). This usually includes project files for platforms like Alexa or Google Assistant (which are then deployed to the platform developer consoles using the [`deploy` command](https://www.jovo.tech/docs/deploy-command))
